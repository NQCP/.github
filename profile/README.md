### Repo quality 
we adopt the 'stoplight' system used by cQED to flag the code quality

copy the above lines into your `README.md` and modify accordingly -- this'll make it easy to get a sense of what's going on :rocket:

<img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=flat-square&label=code-status&message=Caution!&color=red" style=“vertical-align:middle;”/> Here be dragons. This could be code straight from an experiment with no guarantees for its portability. Expect a collection of scripts and just barely `docstrings`
  
<img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=flat-square&label=code-status&message=Good&color=green"/> Decently factored code with well-documented and somewhat portable programming.
  
<img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=flat-square&label=code-status&message=Great!&color=brightgreen"/> High-level fully featured code with many moving parts and used broadly.
